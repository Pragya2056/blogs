# Hosting
Hosting simply means network infrastructure that keeps our website/application available across the internet. Our site, respective data and all other information are stored in server. The Server is responsible for storage and computing resources. Server is nothing but a computer with very high performance capabilities; which provides functionality for other devices i.e. clients.

Servers are basically kept in Data Center, where the following mentioned services must be delivered.
- Temperature control
- Backup system
- Fire suppression
- Physical security 

So, ordering hosting services basically means purchasing:
- Physical disk space on server (storage for website, files, mails etc.)
- Bandwidth which is the network connection for server (website's network traffic that comes in and go out)
As an example, now you will pay for: 10gb of disk space as storage and 100gb of bandwidth per month.

Cloud Hosting has some special features than the normal Dedicated Server Hosting.
In Cloud Hosting rather than storing data in a single node, data are stored within multiple numbers of nodes, which means that even if one server crashes or goes down; clients will not face any technical issues as there are other nodes of server to take over the failure. 

# Difference between Cloud Hosting and Dedicated Server Hosting
Now, lets understand some basic difference between Dedicated Server Hosting and Cloud Hosting

In terms of Availability as we talked before, Cloud Hosting ensures zero downtime as it has multiple nodes to take over the failure. Whereas with dedicated server hosting there is a great chance of downtime as well as hardware failure as its name terms only single dedicated server.
Hence Cloud Hosting prevents Single Point of Failure (SPOF).

In terms of Cost Efficiency, the billing metric in Cloud Hosting supports pay-as-you-go system, which means paying as per the time we use the service i.e. per hour, per month, and so on. We have to pay only for the computing resources that we have used. Whereas with Dedicated Server are generally billed monthly and consistent amount of payment irrespective to the resource that we have used.
